## My process

First I took a screenshot of the desktop deslign and marked how I expected the containers to be divided.
After that I worked on the mobile design. I tried to replicate the design in terms of a top and bottom section, and I thought about individual components like the rating and review cards.
Once I completed the mobile design, I added the containers I would need to make the new layout. I used grid and flexbox to get the sections next to each other and to get the components spaced like the design.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learned that the justify-items property with values like flex-end or flex-start will squish the element towards one end if there is no margin or padding. It caused a small issue with some of the cards but it was a fun learning experience.

### Continued development

As of now, I'm confident with the fundamentals of flexbox and grid. I would like to continue learning more in detail to clear up any holes I have in my understanding.
